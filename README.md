# Optimizing-Hyperparameters-during-Concept-Drift
Optimizing-Hyperparameters-during-Concept-Drift:
<br />
This project is based on Model-based Optimization on Distributed Embedded System (https://github.com/Strange369/MODES-public).
And it is mainly used to explore whether the model needs to re-choose new hyperparameters based on the new data when concept drift occurs in the data.
<br />
The implementation of MODES and corresponding experiments are released here.
<br />
The botorch-modes implementation is based on BoTorch (https://botorch.org/).
<br />
The model regression function is based on the tutorial (https://botorch.org/tutorials/closed_loop_botorch_only).
